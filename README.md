What is jQuery?

jQuery is a JavaScript library. What this means for us is that it allows every browser to read JavaScript code. In the same manner, browser compatibility is a big issue when working on the front-end. This means that the jQuery code you write is suited for use by all browsers without change. We don't want to have to write different versions of our code for different browsers, so cross-browser compatibility is important. All of the jQuery's functions work the same way regardless of which browser the user is running.
 
This simple testing project was created with HTML, CSS and jQuery. When the mouse hovers on an image, that image is replaced by another image (on the same position).  When the mouse hovers out of the image, it brings the original image back.
