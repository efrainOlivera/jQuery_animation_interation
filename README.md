# jQuery_animation_interation

What is jQuery?

jQuery is a JavaScript library. What this means for us is that it allows every browser to read JavaScript code. In the same manner, browser compatibility is a big issue when working on the front-end. This means that the jQuery code you write is suited for use by all browsers without change. JavaScript is interpreted by your browser, and unfortunately, Google Chrome interprets JavaScript differently than Safari, Mozilla and Internet Explorer do.  We don't want to have to write different versions of our code for different browsers, so cross-browser compatibility is important. All of the jQuery's functions work the same way regardless of which browser the user is running.
 
This simple project is writting in HTML, CSS and jQuery as animation.
